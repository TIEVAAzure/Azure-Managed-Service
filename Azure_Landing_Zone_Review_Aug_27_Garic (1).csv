About your organization,What is your organization's current operating model?,"Decentralized operations - If you limit the scope of operations to one workload or a small collection of workloads, complexity can be controlled.

About your organization,What is your organization's current operating model?,Enterprise operations - Enterprise operations are the suggested target state for all cloud operations. Enterprise operations balance the need for control and innovation by democratizing decisions and responsibilities.,,,,,,,
About your organization,What is your organization's current operating model?,"Distributed operations - The existing operating model might be too engrained for the entire organization to shift to a new operating model. For others, global operations and various compliance requirements might prevent specific business units from making a change. A distributing operations approach might be required for those companies. This approach is by far the most complex approach. It requires an integration of one or more of the previously mentioned operating models.",,,,,,,
